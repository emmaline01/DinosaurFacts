BRAINSTORMING

new tab shows a new random dino
if possible, make it a new one each day instead of a new one each tab?
- include a button to generate a new dino
info displayed:
- dino name + pronunication
- picture of fossil and depiction
  - google images api ??
- description
  - ideally a story?? not just dry facts..
- time period

resources
